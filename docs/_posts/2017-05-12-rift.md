# The Rift Keyboard

<img src="{{ '/images/rift/fhmxIsz.jpg' | absolute_url }}" />
This is my DIY, custom split keyboard made of black acrylic and walnut.  I threw in the Apple logo since it needed something there to look finished.  Keycaps are SA Icecaps from PMK

Background is I hate normal staggered keyboards. I like ortholinear but not the small modifiers or lack of keycap options.  This is my latest attempt at an evenly staggered board that uses mostly normal sized keycaps.  Let's call this 'Orthoregular'.  (The extra left hand function keys are so the 'rift' is in the middle of the board.)

Case was laser cut in Black acrylic by Ponoko.  Nice work!

Top and bottom are thin adhesive Walnut veneer

Layers fit perfectly.  I'm going to hide the screw holes with the top veneer layer.

Test fit using brown Gateron switches.

Mahogany oil stain and clear coat for the walnut.

Starting to look awesome...

Here's the layers if not obvious

Tapped out the screw holes with a 3mm tap.  Am using 3mm Allen screws so they are hidden inside

Had to hot glue the switches due to thickness of plate.  Hand wired up to a Teensy 2.0.   Tried to have this all fit in the single 4.5mm hollow, but...

Damn, the Teensy is too thick, so had to hand cut a hole for it  (Will be covered by walnut so nbd)

The Costar stabilizer hooks had to be cut and hot glued in, kept popping out.

I made this Mini USB to Micro USB extender/adapter so I can have better cable options and to keep the Teensy inside.

Works great!   It feels 'different' but is surprisingly comfortable.  Everyone complains about the Shift keys but I use right thumb to shift and never use normal left or right shift.  The 'Tab' is actually CTRL, was the only 1.5u I had.
