# DIY Ergo Keyboard from 1984 IBM 

<img src="{{ '/images/ibm/DbIb0nE.jpg' | absolute_url }}" />
This is my DIY keyboard using vintage IBM 'pingmaster' caps and Alps SKCC switches.  The weird layout is my personal design for an orthoregular symmetrical layout that I really like.

See my previous posts for the background, but it lets me have a comfortable, symmetrical, ergo layout using normal keycap sizes in a 60% case.   This keyboard had some unusual cap sizes so fit them as sanely as I could.

I have two of these NIB 1984 IBM pingmaster keyboards with interesting Chinese input keycaps, but never use due to lack of adapters.  I decided to sacrifice one because I'm a monster.

It's full of linear Alps SKCC Green with relegendable and double-shot caps.

I had a 1mm stainless steel plate cut by Lasergist in my ergo layout.

I'm using it here as a template to glue the walnut case

Looks good.  I stained after with mahogany oil stain

All the beige was killing me, so I painted the insides of a couple of relegendable caps

Tried a new approach for bottom, black acrylic with walnut veneer.  Looks... okay
