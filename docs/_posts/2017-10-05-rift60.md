# My custom Rift 60% keyboard

![]({{ '/images/rift60/GeUlboL.jpg' | absolute_url }})

All the things: Ortho, split, Colemak, GH60, DSA, Hand-wired, Laser-cut, TKL compatible keycaps.

Walnut veneer MDF plate laser cut from Ponoko for ~$50

Stained and waxed the plate,  which is designed to fit standard GH60 60% keyboard cases.

Hot glued Gateron Browns.  The ugly cutout is to make room for Teensy 2.0 controller

Hand-wiring is ugly, but it works

The clever thing about this layout is the keycaps are compatible almost fully with TKL sets - so no need to hunt down weird modifier or spacebar sizes.  I use caps lock as CMD, and thumb to shift when holding down left spacebar.  Right space is layer when held.

Some of you didn't like my last Apple logo so I doubled-down and hot glued on an old-style one from a Mac II

Aluminum case is from NPKC on Amazon.  Keycaps are Think Different from PMK.

This layout is super-comfortable for wrists, and I prefer it to ortho grid layout.  Normal staggered keyboards can go to hell.  I'm actually using 'correct' fingers for columns now.

Before gluing the logo, and I still need to add a detachable cable, currently using a non-removable cable connected to Teensy.
