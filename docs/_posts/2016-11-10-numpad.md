# DIY Mechanical Number Pad

![]({{ '/images/numpad/OXVhrpa.jpg' | absolute_url }})
Wanted a number pad to match my [Atomic keyboard](https://olkb.com), had a top & bottom plates cut from [Lasergist](http://lasergist.com) and wired myself.

I tried hand wiring switches and LEDs, but was a disaster. Went with [Cherry MX breakouts from SparkFun electronics](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13773).   Used a [Teensy controller](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) with custom layout written using [QMK.fm](https://qmk.fm)
