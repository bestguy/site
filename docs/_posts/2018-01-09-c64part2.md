# Commodore 64 Mechanical Keyboard, Part 2

<img src="{{ '/images/c64p2/SngtO97.jpg' | absolute_url }}" />
This is part 2 of my retrofuture ortholinear Commodore 64 keyboard.

I originally mounted the C64 keycaps on my Atomic keyboard, but I missed using the Atomic with other caps and decided to make a nicer, more permanent home for the C64.

<img src="{{ '/images/c64p2/9Teay0J.jpg' | absolute_url }}" />
I picked up a [XD75 PCB](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/xd75re-Custom-Mechanical-Keyboard-75-keys-TKG-TOOLS-Underglow-RGB-PCB-GH60-60-programmed-gh60-kle/3034003_32818745981.html), [stainless plate](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/stainless-steel-plate-for-xd75re-60-custom-keyboard-Mechanical-Keyboard-Plate-support-xd75re/3034003_32821198488.html), and Gateron reds from Aliexpress, total was about $65USD

I need a center mount 2u for the Return/Enter key so I cut one support out with Dremel.

I drilled new MX holes in the PCB

I shrinkwrapped the switch leads to avoid contacting the ground or any leads.

It looks and works great!

I used Gateron reds to be closer to the C64's linear switches

Hard to see but I stabilized the spacebar by flipping the stabilizer forward, and clipping it to the plate with the black bent wire clip you see.

<img src="{{ '/images/c64p2/lOBHh0q.jpg' | absolute_url }}" />
Since the caps are so tall, I wanted a case with taller/thicker sides, so used Bolivian Rosewood to make L-shaped side pieces.

<img src="{{ '/images/c64p2/5A8DsiS.jpg' | absolute_url }}" />
I glued and clamped wood to fit the PCB.

Sanded the case and drilled a hole for the USB.

Stained with a Mahogany stain.

Then I coated and buffed with paste wax.

I hand cut and drilled a Plexiglass bottom.

<img src="{{ '/images/c64p2/Y9TsnWz.jpg' | absolute_url }}" />
Since the XD75 has RGB backlight, I wanted better diffusion so I soda blasted the bottom.

<img src="{{ '/images/c64p2/2WE7tGe.jpg' | absolute_url }}" />
Looks good!

<img src="{{ '/images/c64p2/SRZREdd.jpg' | absolute_url }}" />
Had a friendly neighborhood metal shop cut down a thin stainless plate to back the plexglass.

**Let there be backlight.**
I usually dislike RGB backlighting, but the Commodore logos have rainbow stripes and this a nice homage.
