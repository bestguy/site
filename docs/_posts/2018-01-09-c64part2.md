# Commodore 64 Mechanical Keyboard, Part 2

![]({{ '/images/c64p2/SngtO97.jpg' | absolute_url }})
This is part 2 of my retrofuture ortholinear Commodore 64 keyboard.

I originally mounted the C64 keycaps on my Atomic keyboard, but I missed using the Atomic with other caps and decided to make a nicer, more permanent home for the C64.

I picked up a XD75 PCB, stainless plate, and Gateron reds from Aliexpress, total was about $65USD

I need a center mount 2u for the Return/Enter key so I cut one support out with Dremel.

I drilled new MX holes in the PCB

I shrinkwrapped the switch leads to avoid contacting the ground or any leads.

It looks and works great!

I used Gateron reds to be closer to the C64's linear switches

Hard to see but I stabilized the spacebar by flipping the stabilizer forward, and clipping it to the plate with the black bent wire clip you see.

Since the caps are so tall, I wanted a case with taller/thicker sides, so used Bolivian Rosewood to make L-shaped side pieces.

I glued and clamped wood to fit the PCB.

Sanded the case and drilled a hole for the USB.

Stained with a Mahogany stain.

Then I coated and buffed with paste wax.

I hand cut and drilled a Plexiglass bottom.

Since the XD75 has RGB backlight, I wanted better diffusion so I soda blasted the bottom.

Looks good!

Had a friendly neighborhood metal shop cut down a thin stainless plate to back the plexglass.

**Let there be backlight.**
I usually dislike RGB backlighting, but the Commodore logos have rainbow stripes and this a nice homage.
